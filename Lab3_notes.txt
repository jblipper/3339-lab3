Resistor 1 = 0.997k(on top)
Resistor 2 = 0.995k
Capacitor = 15.2 microF
Blue lead = Vin
Pin 3 = input into breadboard, output from Arduino
Closest rail(very bottom) = input rail
Connected A0 to LED side
Connected A1 to capacitor side

Troubleshooting circuit setup(LED not working):
- Inputs and PWM is correct, but LED didn't light up
- 0V going through R2
